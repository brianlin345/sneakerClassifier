# sneakerClassifier
This is a Django webapp that uses a Keras sequential model to classify uploaded pictures of retro Jordan sneakers.
Currently the model supports can classify Jordan 1, Jordan 4, Jordan 11, and Air Force 1.
The webapp also includes a view feature where users can validate predictions generated by the model.

## Model Setup
The Keras model used contains three sets of 2d Convolutional layers with a ReLU activation function, 2d max pooling layer, and dropout layer that drops 20%,
with 32, 64, and 128 filters respectively. The model then includes a flattening layer followed by two densely connected layers of 64 and 4 neurons each, 
with 4 neurons at the bottom due to four possible classes.
